## Overview
This web application is a one-stop shop for quickly throwing a party. The web application asks the user to enter available liquors and mixers and provides a list of cocktails that can be created with the available ingredients. The application also provides the user with suggestions for playlists that associate well with the cocktail, provides a snippet from Wikipedia and also provides a fun GIF for the drink.
